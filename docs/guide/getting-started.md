3.  Double-click to launch.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint, amd64 / arm64)

For better video playback support on Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint, install:

```bash
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
```

### Linux AppImage (x64 / ARM64)

1. Download the `_amd64.AppImage` (x64) or `_aarch64.AppImage` (ARM64) file from the [latest release](https://github.com/julyx10/lap/releases/latest).
2. Make it executable in your file manager, or run `chmod +x Lap_0.3.3_amd64.AppImage` using the filename you downloaded.
3. Double-click the AppImage to launch Lap.

The AppImage uses system multimedia libraries for video playback. On Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint, install the GStreamer packages listed above.

### Fedora

Check the community [COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/beneedict/lap/) for Fedora packages and installation instructions. New builds may become available later than the main release downloads.

### Windows 10/11 (x64 / ARM64)

1. Download the latest `_x64_en-US.msi` or `_arm64_en-US.msi` installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/julyx10/lap/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer and complete the setup wizard.
3. Launch **Lap** from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

Lap's Windows installer is currently unsigned. If Microsoft SmartScreen blocks the download or installer, choose **Keep anyway** or **More info** > **Run anyway**.

## First Run

When you open Lap for the first time:

1.  **Grant Permissions**: Lap needs access to your folders to display photos.
2.  **Add an Album**: Add a folder containing your photos to your library.
3.  **Let it Index**: Lap will scan your files, generate thumbnails, and build local search data. This happens on your device.

## Import and Explore

- Use **Import…** from an album's context menu to copy media into date-organized folders while preserving filenames and skipping duplicate content.
- Switch between **Grid**, **Filmstrip**, and **Map** from the main toolbar. Use **Map View** to explore geotagged media matching your current filters. Map tiles require an internet connection.
- Adjust thumbnail quality and the RAW thumbnail source in **Settings → Advanced**.
- Organize tags into groups and use the multi-select panel for batch actions.
- Create a **Photo Collage** from selected photos, choose a layout, and export or print the result.
- Browse cached thumbnails and metadata for offline albums; reconnect the storage for actions that need the original files.
- Use RAW preview badges to switch modes or select the paired JPEG/HEIC.

## Updating Lap

On macOS and Windows, use the built-in updater or install the latest package over your existing installation. For Linux DEB installations, install the latest matching DEB package with your package manager.

For AppImage installations, download the new AppImage instead of using the built-in updater. AppImage packages include embedded update information and companion `.zsync` files for delta updates through compatible external tools such as AppImageUpdate.

See the [v0.3.3 release notes](/guide/release-notes/v0.3.3) for the latest changes.
